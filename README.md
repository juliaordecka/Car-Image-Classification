This project focuses on analysing and solving an image classification task to learn the behavior of a racing car in a Gym environment - the aim is to classify images into one of five possible actions that control the car.
The dataset consists of 96Ã—96 color images, each labeled with a discrete action id (0-4). 
In this project I defined two CNN models, which implement a different approach to architecture, optimizers and the use of data augmentation. The project includes data preprocessing (rescaling and normalizing the pixel values). The models are trained and evaluated using key performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. Various hyperparameters such as batch size, number of epochs, and input resolution were tested in order to analyze their effect on the performance of the model.
